## Avoid Conflicts {Syncing your fork} 
 
An easy way to avoid conflicts is to add an 'upstream' for your git repo, as other PR's may be merged while you're working on your branch/fork.    
 
terminal 
git remote add upstream https://github.com/theashu02/SourceNexus.git 
 
 
You can verify that the new remote has been added by typing 
terminal 
git remote -v 
 
 
To pull any new changes from your parent repo simply run 
terminal 
git merge upstream/master 
 
 
This will give you any eventual conflicts and allow you to easily solve them in your repo. It's a good idea to use it frequently in between your own commits to make sure that your repo is up to date with its parent.
